# Nested TicTacToe game: Created using Python

### Instructions: 
Implement this game using a simple pragmatic interface. Implement it so that
each player can be either a human (prompt for input) or an extremely stupid (random-guessing) computer opponent.

### Details: 
This is a variation of the classic game of tic-tac-toe, where 2 players take turns putting X's and O's in a 3x3 grid, and the first to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. In this version, there are 9 instances of the game being played simultaneously. Each turn, a player may make a single move in any one of the 9 game instances. (Note that the game instances can thus become unbalanced in the number of moves if a player does not respond directly but instead plays in another instance.) The game instances are themselves arranged in a 3x3 grid, constituting a meta-game. Each time a player wins a game instance, they take the corresponding square in the meta-game. If a game instance results in a tie, that game instance is replaced with a fresh instance with no moves played. The game is over when a player wins the meta-game.
